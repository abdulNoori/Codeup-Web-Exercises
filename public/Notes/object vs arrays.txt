object vs arrays

arrays are lists. the array has numeric indexes.
we can .forEach() on an array
we can shift, run .length to get the number of elements
we can shift, unshift, push, pop arrays
we can call ANY array method on an array.
Any value can be stored as an element in an array.
arrays just store data

Objects are composed of key => value pairs.
the key is the index is the property's name
Objects bundle together behavior (functions) and data
Objects can have behavior (functions)
Objects can have just data ( state, simple variables, facts)
the behavior on an object (its methods) operates on "this" object itself
